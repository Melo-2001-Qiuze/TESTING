    "## Goals of the Analysis\n",
    "The goal of this data exploration is to analyze step count data for three students (student_1, student_2, and student_3) over a period of several days. Specifically, we aim to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the number of days of data available for each student.\n",
    "2. Examine daily step count information, including average, maximum, and minimum step counts.\n",
    "3. Explore minute-level step count data, looking at the number of non-zero minutes, missing data, average steps per minute, and the maximum and minimum steps in a minute.\n",
    "4. Make observations about the data for each student, including potential patterns of activity or inactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description and Assumptions\n",
    "The dataset provided contains step count data for three students (`student_1`, `student_2`, and `student_3`) over multiple days. Each row in the dataset represents step count information for a specific student at a particular date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "- The step count data is collected using a wearable device or application.\n",
    "- Each student's step count data is recorded at one-hour intervals.\n",
    "- Zero-step counts may indicate inactivity during that hour.\n",
    "- Missing data points may occur due to technical issues or periods of inactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "Based on the goals of this analysis, we predict that we will observe variations in daily step counts among the three students. Additionally, we anticipate finding patterns of activity and inactivity at the minute level, with some students having more consistently recorded data than others."

    "**Variability in Daily Step Counts:** The daily step counts of the individuals vary significantly. Some days show high activity levels, while others have very low or even zero step counts. This variability suggests that daily step count is influenced by factors beyond just morning activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Morning Activity Patterns:** While there is evidence of morning activity for all three students, it is not consistently high for all of them. Student_2, for example, has periods of high activity in the morning, while Student_1 and Student_3 do not consistently exhibit this pattern.\n",

    "In conclusion, while morning activity may be a factor influencing daily step count, it is not the sole determinant. Daily step counts are influenced by various factors, including activity patterns throughout the entire day. To draw more definitive conclusions about the relationship between morning activity and daily step count, a more detailed and complete dataset, as well as statistical analysis, would be necessary."
